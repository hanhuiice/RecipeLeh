## Motivation:
In this fast-paced country, most students have both of their parents out in the working field. 
Many would love to learn some culinary skills in order to prepare a meal for themselves or for their family. Especially in this pandemic where most students are having online 
classes, yet would like to save up money instead of the frequent use of food delivery. Many probably would research online for food recipes, however, would face insufficient 
ingredients at home. In order to complete the food recipe, they are required to purchase additional ingredients which would first defeat the purpose of saving money. Hence, an 
application which would allow the users to be able to input the ingredients that they currently have and would display recipes that use the exact ingredients would be beneficial. 
Adding social media functionalities so that the application is more engaging and like-minded people can interact and learn from each other through constructive feedback.

## Tech Stack :computer:
